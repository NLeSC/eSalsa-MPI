- Fortran <> C indexing

  When using Fortran on top of C MPI, all opaque types (MPI_Comm, MPI_Group, MPI_Request, etc) are 
  translated to Fortran integers. This translation is done by several functions (i.e, MPI_Comm_f2c, etc). 
  For each of these opaque types there are several constants (MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_GROUP_EMPTY, etc), which
  also have some constant integer value in Fortran. At the moment, it is unclear if these constants are the 
  same for all MPI implementations and if these constants have a 'decent' value in each MPI implementation. 

  If not, we're in trouble, as we currently assume these constants to have the 'first allowed natural number 
  values' for each opaque type. For example MPI_COMM_WORLD=0, MPI_COMM_SELF=1, MPI_COMM_NULL=2, etc. This 
  allows us to translate any dynamically generated opaques to any of the values after this constant range 
  (i.e. [3, ..>). Administration and translation can then simply be done using some small static arrays. 
  
- Command line arguments to MPI_Init vanish in Fortran ?
